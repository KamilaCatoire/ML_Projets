# Walmart Weekly Sales

Develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the weekly sales at Walmart stores.

The provided dataset comprises data on weekly sales across various Walmart stores, along with additional variables such as the unemployment rate and fuel price. 

To accomplish the task, the following three steps need to be undertaken:

   - Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and carry out all necessary preprocessing tasks to prepare the data for machine learning purposes.
   - Train a linear regression model to establish a baseline for prediction.
   - Address the issue of overfitting by training a regularized regression model.

Models used :
Linear regression, Ridge, Lasso
